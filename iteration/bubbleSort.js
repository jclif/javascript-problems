//Your version can modify the original array.
//Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most other algorithms are more efficient for sorting large lists.

//Write a method substrings that will take a String and return an array containing each of its substrings. Don't repeat substrings. Example output: substrings("cat") => ["c", "ca", "cat", "a", "at", "t"].
