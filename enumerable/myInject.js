/*

your inject should take a function
As the exercise describes, start the accumulator variable with the first value. Iterate through the rest.
it must also use your myEach function

Implement a my_inject method. Your version shouldn't take an optional starting argument; just use the first element. Ruby's inject is fancy (you can write [1, 2, 3].inject(:+) to shorten up [1, 2, 3].inject { |sum, num| sum + num }), but focus on the block (and not the symbol) version.
